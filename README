I was inspired by some tweets by Mark Pilgrim (http://twitter.com/#!/diveintomark/status/52893029001990144) to try my own hand at writing
a word wall generating script.

As comments littered around the script state, it's currently quite naive
and does not analyze the words themselves; instead, words are randomly selected
until they fit (or we try too many times and bail).

Currently the word walls are not _intentionally_ mirrored (nor is that an
option), however by pure chance they sometimes will be.


Example output:

(happens to be mirrored in both directions)
MEIR
EYRE
IRON
REND



Usage (Python 2.x):
import wordwall
wall = wordwall.wordwall(4)
wall.make()

Either you'll get a wordwall back out or a broken one or an iteration error or ...
Code at its finest!
